The ensuing gaps in access have led to widespread illicit file sharing, resulting in the disintermediation of libraries and the devaluing of publishers. It has therefore become essential to explore alternatives for the delivery of journal literature. We report on the exploration of a new mechanism for the provision of scholarly articles using patron-driven acquisition (PDA). During the 2012&ndash;2013 academic year, the University of Utah Marriott Library, ReadCube, and Nature Publishing Group collaborated on the development and testing of ReadCube Access, an article delivery service designed to allow researchers to immediately access individual articles at a cost lower than traditional interlibrary loan, pay per view, or document delivery.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this session is to explore the economics of collection management from the perspective of supplying needed scholarly articles and discuss how new technologies like ReadCube Access and PDA can support that aim. The session will involve a frank discussion of the effects of and attitudes toward illicit file sharing, from which the audience will learn about the scale of file sharing and how it affects the perceived value and, therefore, funding of libraries. An interactive workshop on cost-per-use assessment for various acquisition mechanisms will elucidate how the economics of acquisition mechanisms change with demand and under which conditions PDA will save libraries money while increasing patron engagement and satisfaction.</p>","doi":"10.5703/1288284315325","journal":{"title":"Charleston Library Conference"},"keywords":["Patron driven acquisition, Collection Management, Library budgets"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2014-06-04","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4903527"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4903526"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"An Alternative Mechanism for the Delivery of Scholarly Journal Articles: ReadCube Access at the University of Utah"},"owners":[109181],"revision":6,"stats":{"downloads":5.0,"unique_downloads":3.0,"unique_views":4.0,"version_downloads":5.0,"version_unique_downloads":3.0,"version_unique_views":4.0,"version_views":5.0,"version_volume":4458695.0,"views":5.0,"volume":4458695.0},"updated":"2021-06-07T08:06:33.240481+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"4898248","created":"2021-06-03T20:45:56.267606+00:00","doi":"10.1162/qss_a_00133","files":[{"bucket":"57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff","checksum":"md5:58995befeeebae9066dafbc0c29a94ad","key":"An International, Multi-Stakeholder Survey about Metadata Awareness, Knowledge, and Use in Scholarly Communications.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff/An%20International%2C%20Multi-Stakeholder%20Survey%20about%20Metadata%20Awareness%2C%20Knowledge%2C%20and%20Use%20in%20Scholarly%20Communications.pdf"},"size":1241518,"type":"pdf"}],"id":4898249,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00133.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00133","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4898249","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4898249","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4898249","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4898249"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Alabama - Birmingham","name":"Kaiser, Kathryn A.","orcid":"0000-0002-6258-4369"},{"name":"Urberg, Michelle","orcid":"0000-0002-2748-811X"},{"affiliation":"Lund University","name":"Johnsson, Maria","orcid":"0000-0001-6650-359X"},{"affiliation":"Crossref","name":"Kemp, Jennifer","orcid":"0000-0003-4086-3196"},{"affiliation":"NISO","name":"Meadows, Alice","orcid":"0000-0003-2161-3781"},{"affiliation":"Spherical Cow","name":"Paglione, Laura","orcid":"0000-0003-3188-6273"}],"description":"<p>The Metadata 2020 initiative is an ongoing effort to bring various scholarly communications stakeholder groups together to promote principles and standards of practice to improve the quality of metadata.

This article describes a pilot project to introduce a new Open Data policy to three IOP Publishing (IOPP) journals as part of IOPP&#39;s commitment to increasing transparency and support for open science. An investigation was undertaken using an automated workflow monitoring tool to understand the impact of this change on authors and the editorial staff. Changes in revised submission processing times and how often manuscripts were returned to the author were measured. An overall increase in the time editorial staff spent processing manuscripts was found as well as an increase in the number of times manuscripts were returned to authors. Detailed analysis shows that manuscripts in which authors claim in the DAS to have included data within the manuscript were the most strongly affected.

PIDs for Open Access to UK Research (&ldquo;PIDs for OA&rdquo;) project Consortium Task Group by Josh Brown and Alice Meadows (consultants, MoreBrains Cooperative), November 2020 and revised January 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of widespread PID adoption have been established as including better workflows and automation for researchers, funders, research organizations, and end-users. Widespread PID adoption also promises much richer data on research activities and processes, with widespread benefits for all stakeholders in the form of new insights into research activities and processes, which will help identify &#39;what works?&#39; and lead to opportunities for improvements and efficiencies. Technical development of leading candidate PIDs has reached maturity, but community adoption has been slow. A new approach is therefore needed to lower the financial, technical, organizational, and human barriers to wider adoption of PIDs. The 2019 PID Roadmap for open access to UK research report 1 recommended forming a &lsquo;multi-PID consortium&rsquo; to optimise access and adoption of five priority PIDs for open research. (See Appendix 1 below for the detailed rationale for this recommendation.) The vision set out in the proposal for a &lsquo;multi-PID&rsquo; consortium is primarily concerned with convening and supporting PID adoption in the UK research community. Subsequent research 2 undertaken as part of the PIDs for OA project, which followed the original report, confirmed that technical and financial barriers to adoption are too high, existing PID adoption is seen as</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4760886","keywords":["PIDs","Persistent Identifiers","Research Infrastructure","MoreBrains","Business case"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2021-05-14","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.4760885","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4760886"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4760885"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"UK \"multi-PID consortium\" business case"},"owners":[109181],"revision":6,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":22.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":23.0,"version_views":30.0,"version_volume":27187369.0,"views":29.0,"volume":27187369.0},"updated":"2021-06-04T08:16:05.830722+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.3907485","conceptrecid":"3907485","created":"2020-06-26T14:53:26.972359+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3907486","files":[{"bucket":"499c3ea3-f75c-42f0-b16c-82a2e1dbf789","checksum":"md5:7b4624632b5e318240af0da9c09b69b0","key":"Virtual Plenary_ Openness Profile.pptx","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/499c3ea3-f75c-42f0-b16c-82a2e1dbf789/Virtual%20Plenary_%20Openness%20Profile.pptx"},"size":10154850,"type":"pptx"}],"id":3907486,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3907486.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/499c3ea3-f75c-42f0-b16c-82a2e1dbf789","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3907485.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3907485","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3907486","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3907486","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3907486","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/3907486","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/3907486"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"Double L Digital","name":"Phill Jones","orcid":"0000-0003-0525-6323"},{"affiliation":"Murphy Mitchell Consulting","name":"Fiona Murphy","orcid":"0000-0003-1693-1240"}],"description":"<p>As part of our work on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.knowledge-exchange.info/projects/project/open-scholarship\">Open Scholarship</a>, we are working to raise awareness of the lack of incentivising mechanisms &amp; research evaluation practices for open scholarship contributions, and work towards a possible solution; through development of an &#39;Openness Profile&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Part of KE&#39;s work on Open Scholarship seeks to enhance the evaluation of research and researchers.
