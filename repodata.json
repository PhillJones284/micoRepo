They define and portray what activities and achievements are considered important in the scientific system. Developing their content and structure beyond the traditional, publication-focused CV has the potential to make research careers more diverse and their assessment fairer and more transparent. This comment presents ten ways to further develop the content and structure of academic CVs. The recommendations are inspired by a workshop of the CV Harmonization Group (H-Group), a joint initiative between researchers on research, academic data infrastructure organizations, and representatives from &gt;15 funding organizations. The proposed improvements aim at inspiring development and innovation in academic CVs for funding agencies and hiring committees.</p>","doi":"10.1057/s41599-021-00929-0","keywords":["Science","Technology and Society","Comment"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2021-10-29","relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5638463"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5638462"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"article","title":"Journal article","type":"publication"},"title":"Ten ways to improve academic CVs for fairer research assessment"},"owners":[221624],"revision":2,"stats":{"downloads":11.0,"unique_downloads":11.0,"unique_views":29.0,"version_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_downloads":11.0,"version_unique_views":29.0,"version_views":29.0,"version_volume":4810234.0,"views":29.0,"volume":4810234.0},"updated":"2021-11-02T13:48:45.874847+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.5636767","conceptrecid":"5636767","created":"2021-11-01T16:29:02.053297+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.5636768","files":[{"bucket":"9acd39e6-e0f3-4063-991e-754c1204c9c3","checksum":"md5:16582d434447fc97e8c105687c22ffd6","key":"PIDs for OA project community survey report..pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9acd39e6-e0f3-4063-991e-754c1204c9c3/PIDs%20for%20OA%20project%20community%20survey%20report..pdf"},"size":1714577,"type":"pdf"}],"id":5636768,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5636768.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/9acd39e6-e0f3-4063-991e-754c1204c9c3","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5636767.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636767","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5636768","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5636768","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5636768","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5636768","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5636768"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"name":"Brown, Josh","orcid":"0000-0002-8689-4935"},{"name":"Meadows, Alice","orcid":"0000-0003-2161-3781"}],"description":"<p>Throughout 2020, Jisc has been running a project to develop and refine a national strategy and roadmap for persistent identifiers (PIDs) to enhance access to UK research.

These are PIDs for grants (Digital Object Identifiers provided by Crossref), organisations (Research Organisation Registry identifiers), outputs (Digital Object Identifiers provided by Crossref and DataCite), people (Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers), and projects (Research Activity Identifiers, provided by the Australian Research Data Commons).</p>\n\n<p>These identifiers are at very different stages of development and maturity, and the project team anticipated significant variations in levels of awareness and adoption. For more mature PID systems, the survey has offered feedback on both user satisfaction and potential areas for development. For newer systems, the survey offers more insight into key areas in which respondents would like to explore their offerings.</p>\n\n<p>The survey was launched at a webinar in late June 2020, and closed on August 21st 2020. It was promoted via blog posts and social media internationally, and via Jisc member communications in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The findings will inform the development of further analyses of particular PID integrations in workflows and systems which will support increased openness for UK research, and improve the efficiency and usability of existing open research workflows.&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.5636768","keywords":["PIDs","persistent identifiers","Jisc","ARDC","Crossref","DataCite"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2020-10-07","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.5636767","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5636768"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5636767"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Persistent identifiers adoption and awareness survey report"},"owners":[221624],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":19.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":31.0,"version_downloads":19.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":31.0,"version_views":42.0,"version_volume":32576963.0,"views":42.0,"volume":32576963.0},"updated":"2021-11-04T13:59:11.356388+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"5633632","created":"2021-10-31T13:26:15.145250+00:00","doi":"10.1002/leap.1361","files":[{"bucket":"593cbf48-98a1-4463-897c-18128f25d28c","checksum":"md5:a62edd8570080b21ef9309203e9d28b4","key":"1-Why openness makes research infrastructure resilient.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/593cbf48-98a1-4463-897c-18128f25d28c/1-Why%20openness%20makes%20research%20infrastructure%20resilient.pdf"},"size":157083,"type":"pdf"}],"id":5633633,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1002/leap.1361.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/593cbf48-98a1-4463-897c-18128f25d28c","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1361","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5633633","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5633633","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5633633","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5633633"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"DataCite","name":"Helena Cousijn","orcid":"0000-0001-6660-6214"},{"affiliation":"Crossref","name":"Ginny Hendricks","orcid":"0000-0002-0353-2702"},{"affiliation":"NISO","name":"Alice Meadows","orcid":"0000-0003-2161-3781"}],"description":"<p>Key Points&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&bull;

Increasing their usage and adoption in the service of open access should bring benefits to many of these applications also, fostering a stronger, more open and efficient research information ecosystem.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.5609266","keywords":["PIDs","persistent identifiers","open access","open science","open research","UK Research","Policy"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-01","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.5609265","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5609266"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5609265"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Developing a persistent identifier roadmap for open access to UK research"},"owners":[221624],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":17.0,"unique_downloads":15.0,"unique_views":20.0,"version_downloads":17.0,"version_unique_downloads":15.0,"version_unique_views":20.0,"version_views":25.0,"version_volume":11955692.0,"views":25.0,"volume":11955692.0},"updated":"2021-10-29T01:48:54.959254+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.5541798","conceptrecid":"5541798","created":"2021-09-30T15:08:56.117020+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.5541799","files":[{"bucket":"435508ef-cf50-4433-a20a-94c3d9016086","checksum":"md5:dfedc74c0954b21e11644d4246aa322a","key":"RDA Slides SHARC KE OP FINAL (1).pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/435508ef-cf50-4433-a20a-94c3d9016086/RDA%20Slides%20SHARC%20KE%20OP%20FINAL%20%281%29.pdf"},"size":3883923,"type":"pdf"}],"id":5541799,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5541799.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/435508ef-cf50-4433-a20a-94c3d9016086","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5541798.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5541798","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5541799","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5541799","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5541799","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/5541799","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/5541799"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"},{"id":"rda-sharcig"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"MoreBrains","name":"Murphy, Fiona","orcid":"0000-0003-1693-1240"},{"affiliation":"MoreBrains","name":"Jones, Phill","orcid":"0000-0003-0525-6323"}],"description":"<p>The Openness Profile is a digital resource, a portfolio of a research contributor&#39;s outputs and activities, accessible in a single place.

Publishers have been at the forefront of PID adoption, from DOIs for articles to ORCID IDs for authors and reviewers. However, publishers are yet to fully realise the range of benefits PIDs could bring, especially in terms of their value in supporting open research.</p>\n\n<p>We present a life-cycle illustration of the benefits of PIDs, derived from a cost-benefit analysis we conducted for Jisc in the UK. The study identified significant benefits for publishers in streamlining internal information management, reducing administrative overhead, and improving the efficiency of submission processes (including payment of APCs) - not to mention improving the author experience. These improvements would enhance the integrity of publishing workflows and add transparency, ultimately increasing trust in research and research outputs. We found that PIDs could save the UK research sector &pound;5.67M over five years, even after significant research sector investment in PID adoption and integrations.</p>\n\n<p>Publishers will only get their share of these benefits if they can rely on funders and institutions to populate PID registries with accurate data to feed publishing processes. At the same time, by embedding PIDs throughout their workflows, in metadata, and in discovery and aggregation tools, publishers will help multiply the benefits of PIDs for institutions and funders.</p>\n\n<p>We present new - and concrete - evidence of the long-hoped-for benefits of a shared PID-enabled open infrastructure, including pointing the way to how to build those benefits into the publishing system. We make the case that more outreach, cooperation, and education is needed across publishing and beyond to deliver those benefits. Our proposed win-win approach would help build trust across all scholarly communications stakeholders, as well as saving everyone time, effort, and money.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.5526255","keywords":["Persistent Identifiers","Cost-benefits","Publishing","Infrastructure"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2021-09-24","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.5526254","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5526255"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"5526254"}}]},"resource_type":{"title":"Poster","type":"poster"},"title":"Wins all the way: bringing the benefits of PIDs home for publishers"},"owners":[255771],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":40.0,"unique_downloads":36.0,"unique_views":64.0,"version_downloads":40.0,"version_unique_downloads":36.0,"version_unique_views":64.0,"version_views":70.0,"version_volume":18728480.0,"views":70.0,"volume":18728480.0},"updated":"2021-09-24T13:48:28.048309+00:00"},{"conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.4991732","conceptrecid":"4991732","created":"2021-06-19T08:18:56.461980+00:00","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.4991733","files":[{"bucket":"4049bab4-fff4-4232-8d2e-c3d578c09ac5","checksum":"md5:094a3d6116f73c106c55a291442f871a","key":"PID-optimised research cycle.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4049bab4-fff4-4232-8d2e-c3d578c09ac5/PID-optimised%20research%20cycle.pdf"},"size":154136,"type":"pdf"}],"id":4991733,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4991733.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/4049bab4-fff4-4232-8d2e-c3d578c09ac5","conceptbadge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4991732.svg","conceptdoi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4991732","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4991733","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4991733","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4991733","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4991733","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4991733"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"MoreBrains Cooperative","name":"Brown, Josh","orcid":"0000-0002-8689-4935"},{"affiliation":"MoreBrains Cooperative","name":"Jones, Phill","orcid":"0000-0003-0525-6323"},{"affiliation":"MoreBrains Cooperative","name":"Meadows, Alice","orcid":"0000-0003-2161-3781"},{"affiliation":"MoreBrains Cooperative","name":"Murphy, Fiona","orcid":"0000-0003-1693-1240"}],"description":"<p>The PID-optimized Research Lifecycle is one in which&nbsp;persistent identifiers are registered, used, and shared at all points.

The ensuing gaps in access have led to widespread illicit file sharing, resulting in the disintermediation of libraries and the devaluing of publishers. It has therefore become essential to explore alternatives for the delivery of journal literature. We report on the exploration of a new mechanism for the provision of scholarly articles using patron-driven acquisition (PDA). During the 2012&ndash;2013 academic year, the University of Utah Marriott Library, ReadCube, and Nature Publishing Group collaborated on the development and testing of ReadCube Access, an article delivery service designed to allow researchers to immediately access individual articles at a cost lower than traditional interlibrary loan, pay per view, or document delivery.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this session is to explore the economics of collection management from the perspective of supplying needed scholarly articles and discuss how new technologies like ReadCube Access and PDA can support that aim. The session will involve a frank discussion of the effects of and attitudes toward illicit file sharing, from which the audience will learn about the scale of file sharing and how it affects the perceived value and, therefore, funding of libraries. An interactive workshop on cost-per-use assessment for various acquisition mechanisms will elucidate how the economics of acquisition mechanisms change with demand and under which conditions PDA will save libraries money while increasing patron engagement and satisfaction.</p>","doi":"10.5703/1288284315325","keywords":["Patron driven acquisition, Collection Management, Library budgets"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"6-9 November 2013","place":"Charleston, SC","title":"Charleston Library Conference","url":"https://www.charleston-hub.com/the-charleston-conference/"},"publication_date":"2014-06-04","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.4905512","relation":"isSupplementedBy","resource_type":"presentation","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4903527"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"4903526"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"An Alternative Mechanism for the Delivery of Scholarly Journal Articles: ReadCube Access at the University of Utah"},"owners":[109181],"revision":9,"stats":{"downloads":35.0,"unique_downloads":31.0,"unique_views":32.0,"version_downloads":35.0,"version_unique_downloads":31.0,"version_unique_views":32.0,"version_views":40.0,"version_volume":31210865.0,"views":40.0,"volume":31210865.0},"updated":"2021-06-27T15:41:44.914060+00:00"},{"conceptrecid":"4898248","created":"2021-06-03T20:45:56.267606+00:00","doi":"10.1162/qss_a_00133","files":[{"bucket":"57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff","checksum":"md5:58995befeeebae9066dafbc0c29a94ad","key":"An International, Multi-Stakeholder Survey about Metadata Awareness, Knowledge, and Use in Scholarly Communications.pdf","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff/An%20International%2C%20Multi-Stakeholder%20Survey%20about%20Metadata%20Awareness%2C%20Knowledge%2C%20and%20Use%20in%20Scholarly%20Communications.pdf"},"size":1241518,"type":"pdf"}],"id":4898249,"links":{"badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00133.svg","bucket":"https://zenodo.org/api/files/57e9b7b4-3196-451d-9268-d38abd14b9ff","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00133","html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4898249","latest":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4898249","latest_html":"https://zenodo.org/record/4898249","self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4898249"},"metadata":{"access_right":"open","access_right_category":"success","communities":[{"id":"morebrains_cooperative"}],"creators":[{"affiliation":"University of Alabama - Birmingham","name":"Kaiser, Kathryn A.","orcid":"0000-0002-6258-4369"},{"name":"Urberg, Michelle","orcid":"0000-0002-2748-811X"},{"affiliation":"Lund University","name":"Johnsson, Maria","orcid":"0000-0001-6650-359X"},{"affiliation":"Crossref","name":"Kemp, Jennifer","orcid":"0000-0003-4086-3196"},{"affiliation":"NISO","name":"Meadows, Alice","orcid":"0000-0003-2161-3781"},{"affiliation":"Spherical Cow","name":"Paglione, Laura","orcid":"0000-0003-3188-6273"}],"description":"<p>The Metadata 2020 initiative is an ongoing effort to bring various scholarly communications stakeholder groups together to promote principles and standards of practice to improve the quality of metadata.

This article describes a pilot project to introduce a new Open Data policy to three IOP Publishing (IOPP) journals as part of IOPP&#39;s commitment to increasing transparency and support for open science. An investigation was undertaken using an automated workflow monitoring tool to understand the impact of this change on authors and the editorial staff. Changes in revised submission processing times and how often manuscripts were returned to the author were measured. An overall increase in the time editorial staff spent processing manuscripts was found as well as an increase in the number of times manuscripts were returned to authors. Detailed analysis shows that manuscripts in which authors claim in the DAS to have included data within the manuscript were the most strongly affected.

Widespread PID adoption also promises much richer data on research activities and processes, with widespread benefits for all stakeholders in the form of new insights into research activities and processes, which will help identify &#39;what works?&#39; and lead to opportunities for improvements and efficiencies. Technical development of leading candidate PIDs has reached maturity, but community adoption has been slow. A new approach is therefore needed to lower the financial, technical, organizational, and human barriers to wider adoption of PIDs. The 2019 PID Roadmap for open access to UK research report 1 recommended forming a &lsquo;multi-PID consortium&rsquo; to optimise access and adoption of five priority PIDs for open research. (See Appendix 1 below for the detailed rationale for this recommendation.) The vision set out in the proposal for a &lsquo;multi-PID&rsquo; consortium is primarily concerned with convening and supporting PID adoption in the UK research community.

Our approach is to raise awareness on the lack of recognition in current evaluation practice and work towards a possible solution.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Openness Profile</strong></p>\n\n<p>The KE Research Evaluation task &amp; finish group worked to improve awareness, listing all academic and non-academic contributions that are essential to Open Scholarship and should be recognised when evaluating research. The group also works on the &#39;Openness Profile&#39;, a tool that is meant to allow evaluation of currently ignored contributions that are essential for Open Science.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By demonstrating the immaturity of current research evaluation practice, and by developing the Openness Profile tool, KE supports researchers as well as non-researchers to get credit for all their contributions that make Open Science possible. Our ambition is that recognition of these essential activities becomes part of standard research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For the development of the Openness Profile, we have been exploring a concept that would recognise contributions to Open Science by documenting these as digital objects connected to a persistent identifier. We envisage the Openness Profile as a collection of documented contributions with a DOI , linked to the contributor&rsquo;s ORCID iD.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There is a concern among the Open Science movement that there is a discrepancy between open science policy and the practices of current researchers. Also, there needs to be a system in place for rewarding research contributors for the Open Science activities they do but are invisible to contemporary research evaluation protocols. The Openness Profile would act as an incentivizing and rewarding tool, as well as a means of turning the OS into standard research evaluation routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Report &lsquo;Openness Profile: Modelling research evaluation for open scholarship&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new report describes mechanisms and approaches to improve and incentivize the recording, evaluation, and recognition of contributions to Open Scholarship practice, this report will be of interest to you. As a follow-up on the report &lsquo;Openness Profile: Defining the concepts&rsquo; (January 2020, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3607579), it presents how the Openness Profile can help address existing gaps in the assessment of open science.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Openness Profile is a digital resource, a portfolio of a research contributor&#39;s outputs and activities, accessible in a single place. Academic and non-academic open scholarship activities become visible and more easily recognised.

Since 2005, our activities have explored how Open Access and Open Science, (a movement which is also known as open scholarship or open research as its scope has reached beyond physical, natural and social sciences), can best deliver their promise.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve recently addressed Open Scholarship at conceptual level, resulting in the KE Open Scholarship Framework and the book &lsquo;The Economy of Open Scholarship and the Need for Collective Action&rsquo;. In parallel we collected use cases of initiatives and services that aim to contribute to Open Scholarship, focusing primarily on the economic challenges they face in a rapidly changing digitised research landscape. Outcomes of this work are published in &lsquo;Insights into the Economy of Open Scholarship: A Collection of Interviews&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>This report documents an investigation into the need for and value of new evaluation approaches of people conducting open scholarship and their outputs. The report provides an extensive overview of strategies, barriers, and community needs regarding openness and explores what contributions an Openness Profile, as introduced in this report, can make to enable desired openness and fairer assessment in research. Examples are the recognition of contributions that traditionally have not been credited, appreciation of &lsquo;different&rsquo; research outputs such as software, and actionable information on infrastructure requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Activities to support the development of the Openness Profile will continue in the coming year. The objective is to bring stakeholders together to proof the concept of Openness Profile in various environments. The result we aim for is a body of knowledge, a mature concept, experiences, as well as a set of recommendations on how the Openness Profile could best be implemented in research practice.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware there is still a long way to go. By sharing the rich findings of the first part of the work we hope to inspire and encourage you in your approaches towards improving openness in research.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3607579","keywords":["Open Scholarship, KE, Knowledge Exchange, Research Evaluation, Researcher Evaluation, Openness Profile, OS Framework, Open Research, Open Science, Identifiers"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2020-01-31","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3607578","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3607579"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3607578"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"report","title":"Report","type":"publication"},"title":"Openness Profile: Defining the Concepts","version":"1"},"owners":[20883],"revision":5,"stats":{"downloads":442.0,"unique_downloads":399.0,"unique_views":1418.0,"version_downloads":442.0,"version_unique_downloads":399.0,"version_unique_views":1418.0,"version_views":1505.0,"version_volume":458770806.0,"views":1505.0,"volume":458770806.0},"updated":"2021-10-27T09:11:51.941473+00:00"}],"total":25},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/records/?sort=mostrecent&communities=morebrains_cooperative&page=1&size=200"}}
